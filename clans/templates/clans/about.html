    <p class="card-text">Salted Vex Milk was developed over a sixty-four year period starting in 2017 by cortical_iv with feedback from members of EC59, and technical help from the Destiny 2 developer community.</p>

    <p class = "card-text">  The <a href="{% url 'members:members' %}">Members</a> page has basic info about each clan member, such as how much time they have played Destiny 2. Each member's name is a link to a page about their different D2 characters.</p>

    <p class = "card-text">For the <a href = "{% url 'pvpstats:pvpstats' stat='kd' %}">PvP</a> and <a href = "{% url 'pvestats:pvestats' stat='number_nightfalls' %}">PvE</a> leaderboards, there is a dropdown menu of stats such as k/d. For both PvP and PvE there is also a <em>Greatness</em> measure, which is a combination of multiple statistics: if your Greatness is 1 or higher, then you are kicking ass. You can sort leaderboards by clicking on the stat at the top: clicking again reverses the order. Stats are expressed in per-game averages when possible.</p>

    <p class = "card-text">Thanks to JokerRed628 for supplying the image on this page. Thanks to Jessamyn Smith at Codementor for helping me figure out the trickier parts of Django development.</p>

    <p class = "card-text"><img alt="salt shaker image" src="{% static  'clans/salt.png' %}" style="height:75px;margin:5px;" align="right">Salted Vex Milk is not affiliated with Bungie. Or Reddit, the Salt King.</p>

    <p class="card-text">If you have suggestions or bug reports, please send me a message at our slack channel or github (<i>cortical_iv</i> in both cases). Note We pull data from Bungie's servers at 4am Eastern each night, so stats may not reflect your most recent pwnage. <a href="https://github.com/cortical-iv/salted_vex_milk" target ="_blank">The source code</a> is available at github. The project uses <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target = "_blank">Django 2</a> for the back end, and <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap4</a> for the front end. </p>
